  Hey there!

</h2>

I'm Lucas, an Information Systems student based in Brazil and currently working as a **Solutions Architect Intern at SYDLE**.

I enjoy designing and building solutions that can be applied in the real world.

If an idea makes sense outside of theory, chances are I’ll try to turn it into something practical.

**Hobbies:**  
🎵 Playing music · 🎮 Gaming · 🛠️ Creating things
